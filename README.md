## Overview

QuickScanPro is a PowerShell script designed to facilitate the scanning of documents and photos, especially Polaroid pictures. It allows users to easily convert scanned images into PDF format. With a simple command-line interface for Windows PowerShell, QuickScanPro integrates external dependencies to enhance functionality, ensuring an efficient and flexible user experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **DPI Selection**: Select the desired DPI (Dots Per Inch) for your scans, with options of **300 DPI**, **600 DPI**, and **1200 DPI**.
- **Post-Scan Options**: After a scan, you can repeat it with the same settings, start a new scan, or exit the application.
- **PDF Conversion**: Automatically convert scanned images to PDF format, with the image adjusted to fit the page.

  2. Change the downloaded file's extension from **.nupkg** to **.zip**.
  3. Extract the ZIP file and locate the DLL in the **lib** folder.
  4. Place the DLL in the same directory as the **QuickScanPro.ps1** script.

### Installing the Script

1. **Clone** this repository or **download** the **QuickScanPro.ps1** script directly to your computer.
2. Ensure the **BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll** and **itextsharp.dll** libraries are in the same directory as the script.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Script
